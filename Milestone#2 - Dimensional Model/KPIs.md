Our audience is made of Airbnb project managers and business executives who are looking to recover from the pandemic financial stress in NY, by promoting the most served rentals in the city in order to generate more revenue. The 5 KPIs listed below are the most important and relevant to our project:
1. Average ratings per location
2. CitiBike available per rental
3. Taxis available (total pickups + drop off) per rental
4. Average price per rental in the area
5. Yearly revenue per location
<br>
These KPIâ€™s will allow us to evaluate the attractiveness (through guests ratings) of each rental and look for an eventual effect generated by citibikes and taxi traffic. We will then analyze the revenues generated by location and come up with a conclusion of whether or not citibikes and taxi traffic really generate higher income to the company.
